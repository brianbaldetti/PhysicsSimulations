# PhysicsSimulations
Physics simulations to model some basic forces and motions of objects using python and glowscript. Some of these simulations are quite nice as their motion is quite beautiful and satisfying to watch.

# NOTICE
I have tried to remove all links and references to my specific class and instructor for this repository so people can not directly copy and paste my code as their own. Also I have not included all my simulations are well so as to not make all the simulations available.
